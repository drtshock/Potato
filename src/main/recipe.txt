HOW TO BAKE A POTATO:
Here is my tried and true best method for how to make baked potatoes in the oven…

Heat oven to 450°F. Yep, you read the temperature right.  The oven needs to be extra hot, so that the potato skins will crisp up quickly.
Prepare your baking sheet.  If you happen to own a wire cooling rack, I highly recommend placing one on top of a baking sheet, so that the potatoes can cook evenly on all sides.  Or if you don’t own a wire rack, you can either place the potatoes directly on the oven racks (with a baking sheet below, to catch any drips) or you can just bake the potatoes on a foil-lined (or parchment-lined, at your own risk) baking sheet.
Poke your potato all over with a fork.  Because no one wants to deal with exploding potatoes. ;)
First bake.  My best advice for how long to bake a potato — in two rounds!  For the first round, bake for about 25 minutes, until the skin starts to feel dry and slightly wrinkly.
Brush the potato with melted butter (or oil). Next, carefully remove the potato from the oven.  Use a pastry brush to brush the potato with melted butter (or oil) evenly on all sides.  Sprinkle the potato with a generous pinch of Kosher salt. (I like mine fairly coarse so that you get a bit of a crunch.)  Then place the potato back on the baking sheet, opposite side up, so that the potato can cook evenly on both sides.
Second bake. Bake for an additional 20 minutes.  Then very carefully, use an oven mitt to squeeze the potato (it will be hot) to check for doneness.  If the insides are nice and soft and give under pressure, remove the potato from the oven.  Otherwise, continue cooking in 5-minute increments until the potato is ready to go.  Cooking time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes, but on average, they typically take 45-55 minutes to cook.
Cut, squeeze, fluff, season and serve!  Finally, slice the potato open lengthwise with a paring knife, give it a good squeeze to open it up, fluff the insides with a fork, add your favorite seasonings or toppings.  Then a perfectly crispy-on-the-outside, soft-and-fluffy-on-the-inside, and oh-so-delicious baked potato will now be yours to enjoy!
