So there is this game called Touhou that people play. http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project Some person made this thingy called Touhou Danmakufu. It is like bukkit since it has random people just make bullet pattern scripts off of it scripts. Coincidentally before the "potato" was created, I was working on a script for my friend "potatofest". Included is part of it. WARNING: it is extremely hard and recommended for extra stagers only. Uses Danmakufu 0.12m (the one that Concealed the Conclusion comes with). Requires Applocale unless your computer is set to Japanese. Enjoy!!!!! If you want to learn how to script Danmakufu stuff see http://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/wiki/Main_Page
